    \section*{Objectives}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use sigma notation to write and evaluate a sum
        \item Understand the concept of area
        \item Approximate the area of a plane region
        \item Find the area of a plane region using limits
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{definition}[Sigma Notation]

        The sum of n terms $ a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, ... ,a_{n} $ is written as: 

        $$ \Sigma_{i=1}^n a_{i} = a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{3} + ... + a_{n} $$

        Where i is the \textbf{index of summation}, $ a_{i} $ is the \textbf{ith term} 
        of the sum, and the \textbf{upper and lower bounds of summation} are n and 1.
        
    \end{definition}

    \begin{problem}[Examples of Sigma Notation]

        The upper and lower bounds must be constant with respect to the index of summation.
        However, the lower bound doesn't have to be 1. Any integer less than or equal to 
        the upper bound is legitimate. 

        \begin{itemize}
            \item $ \Sigma_{i=1}^6 $ \indent $ i $ 
            \item $ \Sigma_{i=0}^5 $ \indent $ (i+1) $
            \item $ \Sigma_{j=3}^7 $ \indent $ j^2  $
            \item $ \Sigma_{j=1}^5 $ \indent $ \frac{1}{\sqrt[]{j}} $
            \item $ \Sigma_{k=1}^n $ \indent $ \frac{1}{n} (k^2+1)  $
            \item $ \Sigma_{i=1}^n $ \indent $ f(x_{i})\Delta x$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{problem}
    
    \newpage

    \begin{theorem}[Summation formulas]
        Provide proofs. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $ \Sigma_{i=1}^n c = cn$, c is a constant
            \item $ \Sigma_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
            \item $ \Sigma_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$
            \item $ \Sigma_{i=1}^n i^3 = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{problem}[Evaluating a Sum]
        Evaluate $ \Sigma_{i=1}^n \frac{i+1}{n^2} $ for $n = 10, 100, 1000, 10,000$.
    \end{problem}
